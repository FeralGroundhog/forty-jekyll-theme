# Work

I'm currently a Solutions Engineer at HashiCorp with a background that looks like that of an Ops generalist. I've administered many different systems (check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonypulickal/)) and I can speak at length about the value of operationalization; even if I can't always pronounce it. Prior to my time as a SysAdmin/DevOps person, I spent a few years in a research lab and, with some amazing co-RAs and PI, published [some things](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CO5CtTQAAAAJ). I don't do anything data mining or biometrics-related anymore but I try to stay involved in healthcare applications of smartphones and IoT devices.

I consider myself a technologist by [Charles Eaton's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-eaton-a04ba/) definition. To sum [his post](https://www.creatingitfutures.org/resources/blog/creating-it-futures/2016/11/14/who-is-a-technologist-):

- Strategy before tactics
- Obstacles are opportunities for solutions
- Be curious, take initiative
- The value of technology is derived from its utility
- Technology is about humans, not hardware
- Respect, cooperation, collaboration

# Life

Let's get the most important thing out of the way: I thought I was a dog person but our cat likes all the attention so I'm a cat person now.

I've been tinkering with electronics since I could hold a screwdriver. I am **very** good at taking things apart. Over time, I've gotten better at putting things back together. When I'm not overcomplicating my family's tech situation or playing with an overly attached cat, I like to dabble in hobbies; carefully avoiding the time and money pits that true enthusiasm entails.

I'm a regular at local auto meetups when the weather is perfect. I've been thinking about starting up a car blog with a friend for several years now (we'll do it this year, I swear). If you want to chat about "new" models ('90s+), the awful things happening with infotainment systems, the amazing things happening with electric cars, or play my favorite game of "Guess that Headlight/Taillight", email me. If you want to talk about classic cars or stuff like drag coefficients and gear ratios, I'll politely nod for a few minutes.

I've been squatting on this domain for a while now (after having lost the .com TLD years ago after I let it lapse for just a day...). I've been using it for lots of things behind the scenes like a mailserver, fileserver, testing space for random work-related things but I finally decided it's time to to put up a proper site. I've grown to love Jekyll during my time at Columbia for a lot of reasons that I'll blog about later but during the build process, I've realized a few things:

- I never paid attention to linting before and now that I'm trying to, I have a lot of bad habits.
- Building services for non-technology-oritented users is hard (blog post about why I'm building this site this way later).
- Making a seamless product while not compromising on things I value (test/staging, security, insulation by abstraction) is really, really hard.
- I have almost no photos of myself that do not include someone else.
- I have thousands (I'm not joking) of photos of the many pets in my life. _THOUSANDS_.
