Over the years, I've read a lot of tech blogs and would occassionally think about starting my own. Impostor syndrome would kick in pretty quickly and I'd toss the notion aside because who am I to presume that anyone would want to read my blog?

At the end of 2018, I went through a rapid series of interviews at HashiCorp and accepted a position in their Solutions Engineering team. During that process and as I was wrapping up with my previous team, I thought a lot about how I had gotten to this point in my career and I realized that my somewhat odd background might actually be helpful to others. So, after years of procrastination and self-doubt, I finally sat down and put this site together. Now, the next time I run into something that I complain about not having any solutions or tips online, I can be that first relevant result!

Stay tuned for the next post about how this site is set up and, more importantly, why it was done that way. I've got a lot of stories saved up and I have a feeling that there are even more to come.
